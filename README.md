Design decisions:

Set max-widths for the content but have not tested it on larger screens as this was not in the brief
Used dummy links for nav as content does not yet exist

Known bugs:

Nav in desktop view not pixel-perfect - due to phantom padding issue I haven't managed to figure out before deadline

Changes or further research I would make which are outside the scope of the project:

More breakpoints - e.g. for larger screens and tablets (the navigation in particular doesn't work well at tablet sizes)
Colour - I stuck to a grey palette in this instance
Responsive design best practice - I'm not sure that the way I organised the CSS, with default styling applied and then a breakpoint for mobile, is current best practice. I would like to explore more about this.
Cross-browser check; experiment with CSS Reset
Typography - replace the Helvetica with something more exciting
